<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>By convention there is no need to refer to the entries of a row or column vector using double indices â€” one of them would always be 1 so we can omit it.  When we have more general matrices, where \(m\) and \(n\) are both greater than \(1\), the roles of rows and columns are more evident and two indices will be necessary to refer to the entries.
