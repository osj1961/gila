<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Now to the special cases.  When the number of columns is \(n=1\), the matrix is known as a <em class="terminology">column vector</em>.  When the number of rows is \(m=1\), the matrix is known as a <em class="terminology">row vector</em>.  There is clearly a choice to be made as to whether the things we have been referring to as (merely) “vectors” are going to be represented as column vectors, or as row vectors.  Here's a surprising thing!  Your Calculus teachers and I (up until now) have been lieing to you.  When we wrote vectors as (for example) \(\vec{v} = \langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle\), it was only for convenience.  A row of numbers fits more easily on the page than a column does.  For a variety of reasons it makes sense to treat vectors as columns of numbers, not rows.
