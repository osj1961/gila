<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>There is an operation known as <em class="terminology">transposition</em> that changes row vectors into column vectors and <i class="foreign">vice versa</i>.  The <em class="terminology">transpose</em> of a matrix is indicated by a superscript T, the rows of the transposed matrix are the columns of the original matrix and its columns are the original matrix's rows.  This idea (interchanging rows and columns) is surprisingly important and we'll be using it quite a bit in the future.  For the moment let's just notice that it gives us a nice way to write a column vector â€” with the typographical advantage that the components appear in a row!
