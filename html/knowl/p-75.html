<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>More specifically, there are three operations that can be applied to linear systems which <!--Style me with CSS--><em>do not have any effect on solution sets</em>.  We can apply these three operations in any way we like!  We'll just be transforming our linear system into a slightly different one that is equivalent to the original.  Finally, you'll see that it is pretty easy to strategize a bit and transform difficult linear systems into the nice sort (where the solution set is very evident) using these three operations.
