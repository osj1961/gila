<p>Linearity is a really important concept!  We will be using the definition above over and over again.  Let's try to nail down our understanding of this definition by translating it into ordinary language: A transformation is linear if and only if when you apply it to a linear combination of vectors, the result is equal to what you get if you form the same linear combination of the images of those vectors.  More succinctly: “The image of a linear combination is the same linear combination of the images.”  My advice (seriously!) is to treat that last phrasing like a mantra — repeat it to yourself until you fully absorb the meaning and it becomes second nature to you.
