<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>If you've ever done the challenge where you rub your belly in a circular motion while simultaneously patting your head, then this shouldn't be too difficult.  What you need to do is trace across the entries of a row with your left index finger, while simultaneously tracing down the entries of a column with your right index finger.  As you encounter the entries you multiply them and keep a running tally of the sum of these products.
