<p>Now, let's go ahead and figure out what the values of the variables should be.  In other words, how many shares of each stock should we purchase?
</p>
<p>First, look at that middle equation.  It isn't very complicated, indeed, it basically <!--Style me with CSS--><em>tells</em> us the value of \(x_3\) — we just need to divide both sides by 12 to get that \(x_3 = 333.\overline{3}\).  Unfortunately, we can't buy fractions of a share of stock so we'll round to \(333\).
</p>
<p>We're somewhat lucky in that the variable \(x_3\) doesn't appear in the other equations, but <!--Style me with CSS--><em>even if it did</em>, we could now substitute the value we just determined for it.  Furthermore, at this point, we have no more use for that middle equation; we've used it up in finding the value of \(x_3\).  So now we've reduced our problem to a simpler system — one that consists of just two equations in the remaining two unknowns.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{3}
20 x_1 \amp {}+{} \amp  9 x_2   \amp {}={} \amp 6000 \\
20 x_1 \amp {}-{} \amp 27 x_2   \amp {}={} \amp 0
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>If we subtract the first equation from the second we get
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{3}
  \amp {}-{} \amp 36 x_2   \amp {}={} \amp -6000
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
and this tells us (just divide both sides by \(-36\)) the value of \(x_2\). 
</p>
<p>What we've determined so far is that \(x_3 = 333\) and \(x_2 = 167\). By substituting those values into the very first equation we wrote down we'll be able to find the value of \(x_1\).
</p>
<p>After making those substitutions we get an equation that only has one variable:

\begin{gather*}
20 x_1 + 9 \cdot 167 + 12 \cdot 333 = 10000.
\end{gather*}

It's child's play to find the solution is \(x_3=225\).

So in the end we should put in an order for 225 share of SCTY, 167 shares of SPWR and 333 shares of FAN.  Notice that because of rounding we've come up one dollar short of our intended investment.
