<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>What does it mean to say we have found an “answer” to a system of equations?  Essentially, it is this: we have found a set of values for the variables that “work” in all of the equations.  Sometimes people say that this set of values “satisfies” the equations.  To be completely clear, what is meant is that if one substitutes these values for the variables in the equations of the system, all of them (the equations) will be true.  It is convenient to regard such a set of values as a vector.  For example the solution we obtained in Example <a knowl="./knowl/ex-invest.html" knowl-id="xref-ex-invest" alt="Example 1.2.3 Investments" title="Example 1.2.3 Investments">1.2.3</a> would be regarded as the vector \(\langle 225, 167, 333 \rangle\).
