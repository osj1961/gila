<p>If we said nothing further, we'd have just this one equation and there are many possible sets of values for the variables that satisfy it.  Notice that there are two broad categories of companies represented in our stock picks -- solar energy and wind power.  Perhaps we'd be wise to split our investment between them based on some rational theory, for the sake of argument let's say that we've been advised to use a 60/40 split between solar and wind.  What was previously a single equation is now two:

\begin{gather*}
20 x_1 + 9 x_2 = 60000,\\
12 x_3 = 40000.
\end{gather*}
