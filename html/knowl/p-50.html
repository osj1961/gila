<p>Notice that the second equation uniquely determines the value of \(x_3\) but that the other variables still have a bit of freedom.  (For instance, notice that we could set either \(x_1\) or \(x_2\) to \(0\), and the other variable's value would then be uniquely determined. Or, of course we could have some mixture where our $\(6,000\) is split up between the two companies.  As it happens, these two companies are competitors and there is some probability that one will succeed and the other will fail.  A wise investor tries to guess what that probability is and “hedge” their bets on the market.  For the sake of argument let's say we think SCTY is three times more likely to come out the winner in this competition.  You might be inclined to just buy only the SCTY stock, but that's not what a hedging strategy would indicate -- you should mix your investments in a proportion that reflects the probabilities involved.  As an equation in the \(x\)'s we have

\begin{gather*}
20 x_1 = 3 \cdot 9 x_2.
\end{gather*}
