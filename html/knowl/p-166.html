<p>One useful way to think about matrices is the following:  When we write down a system of equations, a lot of the symbols that we write are redundant.  If we eliminate all of the stuff that is utterly predictable we are left with a table of numbers â€” in other words, a matrix.  So one way to think of matrices is that they are highly abbreviated ways of referring to a system of linear equations.  In this scheme the rows of the matrix correspond to the individual equations in the system and the columns contain all the
coefficients that multiply a given variable.  A short example will probably help:
