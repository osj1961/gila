<p>Okay, so now the promised two steps forward.  First, notice that in every equation in the system every variable is present and they all appear in ascending order.  If we were only given the lists of coefficients we'd easily be able to reconstruct the equations.  So, we're going to eject all of the plus signs and all of the variables with all of those subscripts.  We just won't deign to write them down! Sometimes it's a good idea to imagine their presence but it certainly isn't necessary to. Also, the equals signs that separate the left- and right-hand sides of the equations always come before the very last number.  There really isn't a lot of information conveyed by the appearance of those equals signs, but we usually keep a slight vestige of them around â€” a thin vertical line separates the last column of the matrix form from everything else.  So, with no further ado, here is the matrix form of this system:

\begin{equation*}
\left[ \begin{array}{rrrr|r}
 1 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp 3  \amp 101 \\
 2 \amp {-1} \amp  1  \amp 1 \amp  102 \\
 0 \amp  3 \amp {-1}  \amp 2  \amp 103
\end{array} \right]
\end{equation*}
