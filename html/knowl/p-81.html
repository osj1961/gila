<p>Scaling is another operation where it is fairly obvious that there will be no effect on solution sets.  Scaling involves multiplying both sides of an equation by some non-zero constant.  Very often that non-zero constant will be the reciprocal of the coefficient of one of the variables; scaling by such a constant is useful in solving for that variable.  Perhaps it is clear that multiplying both sides of an equation by the same thing will have no impact on what values of the variables satisfy the equation…  But why does the constant need to be non-zero?  Multiplying both sides of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> equation by \(0\) will produce a new equation that looks like \(0 = 0\) which is certainly true!  In fact, of course, that's what the problem is; if the equation was previously false for some vector of variable values (thus it served to exclude that vector from the solution set) it will now be true.  So vectors of variable values that previously were not in the solution set will now be in it — that's the sort of thing we are trying to avoid!
