<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>When we added the equations \(x+y=42\) and \(x-y=6\), obtaining the new equation \(2x=48\) back in Section <a href="section-start.html" alt="Section 1.1 Getting started" title="Section 1.1 Getting started">1.1</a> we were really doing a “Combining” operation.  By the way, when we divided both sides of that new equation by \(2\) we were “Scaling.”
