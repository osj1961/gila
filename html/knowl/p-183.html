<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The easiest example (and also a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>very</em> instructive example) of multiplying vectors is the product of a 
row and a column vector.  Provided they have the same number of entries, a row vector times a column vector produces 
a \(1 \times 1\) matix — also known as a real number.  You have almost certainly seen this before!  The dot product of two vectors is actually a row/column matrix product.  In fact, in many settings they will
write \(\vec{x}^T\vec{y}\) rather than \(\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}\) when referring to the dot product.  As you move towards more advanced math the tendency will be to call this the “inner product” rather than the “dot product”, one reason to make the change (other than it sounds more sophisticated) is that there is also an “outer product” of vectors which is what you get if you multiply a column times a row.  As we'll see shortly, \(\vec{x}^T\vec{y}\) and 
\(\vec{x}\vec{y}^T\) are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>extremely</em> different!  Anyway, we need to do this row/column product as a component of the general matrix product computation so let's proceed to over-explain it by some huge factor…
