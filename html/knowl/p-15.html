<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>There are a small number of simple procedures that we can apply to systems without effecting their solutions.  We can use these operations to convert almost any system into one that looks like that latter form (each equation just states what the value of some variable is). We'll get around to the full story in section <a href="section-sys_eqs.html" alt="Section 1.2 Systems of equations" title="Section 1.2 Systems of equations">1.2</a>, but for now, notice that if we add the two original equations together (adding equations means adding left sides and adding right sides separately) we get something that only involves \(x\).  And of course, once we know one of the variables it isn't very hard to find the other.
