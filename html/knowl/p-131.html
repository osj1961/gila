<p>The most important transformations for us in this context are the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>linear</em> ones.  In a linear transformation, the components of the output vector are computed from the components of the input vector by “multiplying by constants and adding everything up.”  Because of the simplistic way that the outputs are computed there is really nothing that can go wrong!  With ordinary functions from \(\Reals\) to \(\Reals\) we usually look at the rule for computing the output and recognize certain values that must be eliminated from the domain — typically where one sees “division by zero” or “square root of a negative” errors.  No such problem can arise with linear transformations, the domain will always be a real Euclidean space of some dimension.  Similarly, the codomain will be a real Euclidean space; one whose dimension is simply the number of components in the output vectors.  The dimensions of the domain and codomain are easy to think about — how many components do the input and output vectors have?  The range of a linear transformation is slightly more complicated.  The output vectors that actually occur will certainly be vectors having the number of components as specified by the codomain, but do all such vectors necessarily have to appear as outputs?  In general, no.
