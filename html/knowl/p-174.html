<p>If \(A\) and \(B\) are matrices, what would it mean to add them?  As was the case with vectors, it doesn't make any sense to add them unless they are the same size.  With vectors they needed to have the same number of components in order to even think about adding them.  With matrices the restriction is even stronger; they need to have the same number of rows <!--Style me with CSS--><em>and</em> of columns.  Provided that that restriction is met, we just add the corresponding entries.
