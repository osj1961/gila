<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Look back at the formal definition of linearity, and notice what it looks like symbolically: It appears as if the transformation \(T\) distributes over the sum and that the scalars can be moved to the outside of the \(T\)'s.  
Sometimes an alternative definition of linearity is given which splits out these two issues.  This is sometimes useful in formulating a proof that some transformation is linear (because it separates the argument into simpler parts).
