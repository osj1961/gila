<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Generally speaking, a table of numbers will have some arbitrary number of rows and of columns.  There are some special cases that we'll need to talk about, but let's look at the general situation first.  We'll use the variable \(m\) to refer to the number of rows in a matrix and the variable \(n\) to refer to the number of columns.  We'll use upper-case letters (about 90% of the time: \(A\)) to refer to the whole table as a single entity, in which case we'll speak of \(A\) being an \(m \times n\) matrix.  The entries of a matrix will usually be denoted using the corresponding lower-case letter with <!--Style me with CSS--><em>two</em> subscripts.  This is (hopefully) reminiscent of the doubly-indexed quantities we saw near the end of Section <a href="section-transformations.html" alt="Section 1.4 Transformations" title="Section 1.4 Transformations">1.4</a>; the components of a linear transformation.
