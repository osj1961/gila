<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The notation for systems of equations gets a bit complicated when we try to write them in general (that is, without particular values given for the various constants involved).  There are three sorts of things that need names in such a system: the variables, the coefficients of the variables, and the numbers on the right-hand sides.  There is a convention that is fairly universal for the names and numbering of these elements.  The variables are \(x\)'s with subscripts, the right-hand sides are \(b\)'s with subscripts, and the coefficients are \(a\)'s with <!--Style me with CSS--><em>two</em> subscripts (we need to indicate the equation that a given coefficient is in and also, which variable it is multiplying.
