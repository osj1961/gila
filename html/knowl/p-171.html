<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Matrix notation was probably invented purely out of laziness.  When we use the Re-ordering, Scaling and Combining operations that we introduced in Section <a href="section-sys_eqs.html" alt="Section 1.2 Systems of equations" title="Section 1.2 Systems of equations">1.2</a>, we find ourselves having to re-copy the entire
system over and over.  By switching to matrix notation we get a considerable savings in effort.  The operations that we
originally developed to use on equations now become operations that one can apply to the rows of a matrix — a.k.a. row operations — which we will study in much greater depth in Section <a href="section-row-ops.html" alt="Section 2.4 Row operations and Gaussian elimination" title="Section 2.4 Row operations and Gaussian elimination">2.4</a>. Regardless of the origins of matrix notation, nowadays we don't think of matrices only in terms of being abbreviations for linear systems.  They have taken on a life of their own!
