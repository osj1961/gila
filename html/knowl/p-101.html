<p>The addition of vectors is best thought of in terms of “directions”.  Suppose the directions to got from my house to the Kwik-E-Mart are: “go 3 blocks north and 1 block east” (call that vector \(\vec{v}\), we might write it's component form as \(\vec{v} = \langle 1, 3 \rangle\)).  Suppose in addition that the directions to go from the Kwik-E-Mart to Moe's Tavern are “go 1 block north and 2 blocks west”
 (let's call this \(\vec{w} = \langle -2, 1\rangle\)).  The meaning of the vector sum is the vector that describes the change that would be effected if we follow one set of directions followed by the other — except we don't have to be slavish about it — we don't literally follow the first set of directions and then do the second.  The sum is the set of directions that take us directly to Moe's without making a Kwik-E-Mart pit stop.
