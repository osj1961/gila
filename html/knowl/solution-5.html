<p id="p-113">Notice that since the left-hand side vectors are all the same as before we can reuse our previous work.  The final form of the vector equation is 
\begin{gather*}
\langle x_1 + x_2, x_1 + x_2, x_2 + x_3 \rangle = \langle 2, 2, 4 \rangle .
\end{gather*}
</p>
<p id="p-114">Now, as a system of equations, we have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp \amp \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp \amp \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp {}+{} \amp x_3  \amp {}={} \amp 4
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}

and the first two equations are identical — they no longer cause a contradiction.  This system not only has a solution, it has <!--Style me with CSS--><em>lots</em> of them!
</p>
<p id="p-115">When one equation is an exact duplicate of the other, is there really any reason to retain both copies in the system?  Remember that we are mostly concerned with solution sets to linear systems. Either of the copies of this equation will have the same effect on solution sets.  For a given vector, they will both either say “Sure! it works for me, put it in the solution set” or “No way, that vector is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> okay with me! It makes me false.”  So, from the perspective of solution sets, this system is really just a system of two equations in three unknowns.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp \amp \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp {}+{} \amp x_3  \amp {}={} \amp 4
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p id="p-116">By subtracting the first equation from the second we get a unique value for \(x_3\) (\(x_3=2\)).  But any pair of numbers that add up to \(2\) will work for \(x_1\) and \(x_2\).  Not only is the solution not unique, the solution set for this system is infinite!
</p>
<p id="p-117">We can express the solution set of this system using set-builder notation and a parameter.
  \begin{gather*}
 \left\{ \langle 2-t, t, 2 \rangle \suchthat t \in \Reals \right\} 
\end{gather*}
</p>
<p id="p-118">Notice how the parameter \(t\) allows the values of \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) to range over all possibilities that add up to \(2\)?  We essentially let \(x_2\) have any value whatsoever (\(t\) can be any real number) and then we choose \(x_1\) in such a way that the sum is \(2\).  In a situation like this, \(x_2\) is known as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>free variable</em>.
