<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>There are two features of matrices that we'll explore in the remainder of this section.  The first is that matrices may be thought of as “funny shaped” vectors.  The second is that, under certain conditions, we can multiply matrices.  If you've already studied multi-variable calculus (and perhaps even if you haven't) you'll have run into the dot product (a.k.a. scalar product) and the cross product (a.k.a. vector product) in \(\Reals^3\).  No matter what the dimension of the space, there is always a dot product.  On the other hand, there is usually nothing analogous to the cross product — it depends on a very special coincidence, an odd fact about the space \(\Reals^3\).  The dot product is a way of multiplying vectors, but the product is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a vector.  On the other hand, the cross product <!--Style me with CSS--><em>does</em> result in a vector.  Matrices (as “funny shaped” vectors) give us a way of multiplying vectors and getting other vectors.
