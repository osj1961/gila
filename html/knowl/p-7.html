<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In Economics there is a high-dimensional entity known as the Leontief Input-Output model.  In
this model the state of an Economic system is described by a large number of real quantities, one for each sector of the economy.  In a 1965 Scientific American article Wassily Leontief (who won a Nobel prize for this work) described his model in terms of a “toy example” where the economy was divided into 82 sectors.  Today one could easily develop a Leontief I/O model where the economy was divided up into a million sectors.  Perhaps this is why Economists make even bigger bucks.
