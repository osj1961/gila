<p>By convention, people usually call a linear transformation \(T\) and use a notation that looks just like Euler notation for functions (because in fact, that's what it is!)

\begin{gather*}
 T( \langle x,y \rangle ) = \langle u, v \rangle . 
\end{gather*}

There are two kinds of problems one can ask: maybe you know the input vector and you'd like to find the output vector, or vice versa.  When you've got the input it's very easy to find the output!  You just plug in.  The more interesting question is when it's vice versa, suppose you know that \(\langle u, v \rangle = \langle 42, 6 \rangle\) how can you arrive at the solution \( \langle x,y \rangle  = \langle 24, 18 \rangle \)?  We'll be looking at this kind of thing in more depth in Section <a href="section-transformations.html" alt="Section 1.4 Transformations" title="Section 1.4 Transformations">1.4</a>.
