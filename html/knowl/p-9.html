<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>There are three different ways of looking at linear algebra problems: systems of linear equations, vector equations, and transformations.  These three views actually represent the same underlying structure, just in different ways.  There are various situations where one of these three viewpoints is preferable, so it is a good idea to be able to switch back and forth between these representations.
