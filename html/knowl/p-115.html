<p>When one equation is an exact duplicate of the other, is there really any reason to retain both copies in the system?  Remember that we are mostly concerned with solution sets to linear systems. Either of the copies of this equation will have the same effect on solution sets.  For a given vector, they will both either say “Sure! it works for me, put it in the solution set” or “No way, that vector is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> okay with me! It makes me false.”  So, from the perspective of solution sets, this system is really just a system of two equations in three unknowns.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp \amp \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   x_2 \amp {}+{} \amp x_3  \amp {}={} \amp 4
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
