<p>There is a bit of an asymmetry in the way we speak of the various sets that are related to a function.  On the output side we have the codomain and the range.  On the input side we have only the domain.  There is no agreed upon name for a set that contains the domain, we simply insist that the function must be defined for every element of the domain (which basically sidesteps the issue).  For the ordinary functions that one sees in calculus, the codomain is the real numbers; the range and domain are generally subsets of the real numbers.  And so, the situation isn't terribly complex.  When we are dealing with transformations things are harder.  The domain and codomain of a transformation are generally real Euclidean spaces — potentially of different dimensions — so we will usually want to spell out what sorts of vectors are expected as inputs, what sorts of vectors will we see as outputs and only then do we get around to the heart of the matter: how do we compute the output from the input?  We'll introduce the notation for a transformation via an example and then treat the general case.
