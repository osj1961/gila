<p>A big "Thank You!" to the students at SCSU who inspired this project and helped to make it a reality.  I'd also like to thank my colleagues in the SCSU Math department whose encouragement gave me the strength to get started on this.  This book was created using only open-source tools:  MathbookXML, LaTeX, GIT, GIMP, XFig, OpenSCAD and Sage; thank you to all of the developers and the communities that selflessly donate their time and efforts to building and maintaining these projects.  Finally, I'd like to gratefully acknowledge the support provided by my institution (and hence, by the taxpayers of Connecticut) -- a one semester sabbatical leave during which I did the bulk of the design and writing.</p>
