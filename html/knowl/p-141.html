<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Before we can go any further we have a small moral obligation to take care of.  Since we've just presented two  definitions for a concept we have a duty to verify that they actually define the same concept.  If we state that two things are the same, that really aren't, we're making a <em class="terminology">false equivalence</em>.  One of the hallmarks of a good critical thinker is that they won't be taken in by false equivalences.  So, what do you think?  Are they definitely the same idea, or are there transformations that are linear by one definition but not by the other?</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-transformations.html#p-141">in-context</a></span>
