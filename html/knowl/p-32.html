<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The first is a real-valued function of two variables â€” think of it as taking a vector as input and returning a scalar.  The second is a vector-valued function of a single real variable.  The mapping that gives temperature as a function of position on a metal plate is an example of the first sort.  When we represent the position of a particle moving around in space (as a function of time) we are using the second sort.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-start.html#p-32">in-context</a></span>
