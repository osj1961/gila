<p>For those who are familiar with chess, you'll know that bishops are forever trapped on the same color square — one of your bishops is always on black and the other always on white. This means that some “bishop moving questions” won't have solutions — for example, a bishop sitting at the origin, \((0, 0)\), can never move to \((0, 5)\); those squares have opposite colors! To get around this limitation we're going to let our bishops make fractional moves. For instance if it starts at the origin and makes \(1/2\) of the upper-right move then it will arrive at \((1/2, 1/2)\).  Now, getting a little stranger, we're going to also allow our bishops to make negative moves. Maybe we should think of a negative move as “undoing” a regular move…
