<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>This one is about as easy as a system of two equations in two variables can get. Actually, that's not quite true.  The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>easiest</em> form for a system of two equations in two unknowns is if they basically just are statements of the answer, like:

\begin{gather*}
x=24\\
y=18.
\end{gather*}

Solving a system of equations just means (somehow) transforming it from something like the first form to something like this latter form.
