<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>We have previously seen the idea of a linear combination of numbers.  In this section we will look at forming linear combinations of vectors.  The typical problem of the vector equations sort is: can we find the coefficients so that a linear combination of some set of vectors (with those coefficients) is equal to a given vector?
