<p>When we do Linear Algebra in two dimensions we are indeed talking about lines.  One of the classic problems is to figure out whether two lines intersect and if so, where.  This is a situation where our ability to visualize things in two dimensions can lead us straight to the answer.  That is certainly not the case in a million (or even in six) dimensions.  Fortunately, there are calculational techniques that work (and even work fairly quickly on a good computer) in
just about any number of dimensions you may be interested in.
