<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>One final word about equivalence relations (in general) and the equivalence of linear systems (in particular):  It is customary, when introducing this notion, to ask students to come up with a proof that shows that some given relation (in this case, equivalence of linear systems) is indeed an equivalence relation.  Such proofs are actually relatively straightforward, but <!--Style me with CSS--><em>relax</em>, we're going to let you off the hook this time!  Showing that equivalence of linear systems is an equivalence relation is actually too easy.  What one needs to do is show that it has each of the three properties: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.  Each of those is an almost immediate consequence of the way this equivalence is defined.  We define two systems to be equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set. In other words, equivalence is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>defined</em> in terms of set equality.  Set equality is definitely an equivalence relation, so it has the three properties.  Finally, the arguments that show that equivalence of linear systems has the three properties all have the same form: in order to show that the equivalence of linear systems has a property we use the fact that set equality has that property.  This is called inheritance.
