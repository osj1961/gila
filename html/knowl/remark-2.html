<p id="p-66">The equivalence of linear systems is an example of what is known  as an equivalence relation.  Equivalence relations are used in theoretical mathematics when we are trying to capture the notion that two things — while not <!--Style me with CSS--><em>actually</em> equal — are similar enough that we can treat them as being sort of a junior version of equal…  
</p>
<p id="p-67">For a relationship to earn the title “equivalence relation” it must have a short list of properties.  These properties are certainly true of the ordinary equals sign:
</p>
<p id="p-68">
</p>
<dl id="dl-1" class="description-list">
<dt id="li-1">reflexivity</dt>
<dd><p id="p-69">A relation is reflexive iff all elements are related to themselves.
</p></dd>
<dt id="li-2">symmetry</dt>
<dd><p id="p-70">A relation is symmetric iff whenever \(x\) and \(y\) are a pair of elements that are related, then \(y\) and \(x\) are also a pair that are related.  (I.e. the order can always be reversed.)
</p></dd>
<dt id="li-3">transitivity</dt>
<dd><p id="p-71">Perhaps you've heard the phrase “Two things that are equal to a third must be equal to each other.” That's the essence of transitivity.
</p></dd>

There really is much more that we should say about equivalence relations in general and the consequences that ensue when we can show that some relation is an equivalence relation.  We refer the interested reader to chapter 6 in <a class="external-url" href="https://osj1961.github.io/giam/" target="_blank">GIAM</a>.  In the remainder of this book we are going to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>see</em> how very useful the notion of equivalence of linear systems can be.  Hopefully this will give you some indication of how useful equivalence relations in general can be!  
</p>
<p id="p-73">One final word about equivalence relations (in general) and the equivalence of linear systems (in particular):  It is customary, when introducing this notion, to ask students to come up with a proof that shows that some given relation (in this case, equivalence of linear systems) is indeed an equivalence relation.  Such proofs are actually relatively straightforward, but <!--Style me with CSS--><em>relax</em>, we're going to let you off the hook this time!  Showing that equivalence of linear systems is an equivalence relation is actually too easy.  What one needs to do is show that it has each of the three properties: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.  Each of those is an almost immediate consequence of the way this equivalence is defined.  We define two systems to be equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set. In other words, equivalence is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>defined</em> in terms of set equality.  Set equality is definitely an equivalence relation, so it has the three properties.  Finally, the arguments that show that equivalence of linear systems has the three properties all have the same form: in order to show that the equivalence of linear systems has a property we use the fact that set equality has that property.  This is called inheritance.
