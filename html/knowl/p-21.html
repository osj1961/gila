  Consider the piece known as a bishop. If you're not familiar with chess, this is the piece that can move in the diagonal directions. Think of the bishop as having two moves that it can do (but it can do them any number of times). It can do a move we'll refer to as UR; move one unit in the \(x\) direction while simultaneously moving one unit in the \(y\) direction — by doing this multiple times the bishop can travel in the upper right direction. It also has a move that allows it to travel along the other diagonal — move one unit in the \(x\) direction while simultaneously moving negative one unit in the \(y\) direction. We'll call that move LR.
