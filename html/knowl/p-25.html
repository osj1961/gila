<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The things we've been calling UR and LR are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>vectors</em>.  If you ask someone from the physical sciences to define a vector they'll say “it's a thing that has both a magnitude and a direction”.
(Which is fine as far as it goes.)  Meteorology provides some nice examples. A weather map often shows a lot of basic data about the conditions at various places — wind, temperature, barometric pressure and humidity are common.  Of these, only the wind is a vector quantity, it needs to be specified with both a magnitude and a direction (e.g. 15 mph out of the Northeast), the others all just have magnitudes.
