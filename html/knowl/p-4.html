<p>This is a free/open-source textbook that provides an introduction to Linear Algebra.  There is a light emphasis on 
  mathematical proof and a strong emphasis on applications, making this book appropriate for science and engineering 
  majors and for mathematics majors who are taking Linear Algebra early in their college careers.  Math majors who have 
  already had an introduction to proofs course -- my other open-source textbook “A Gentle Introduction to the Art of 
  Mathematics” was written for such a course -- may benefit from a more advanced treatment that features proof.
  A good choice would be “A First Course in Linear Algebra” (a.k.a. FCLA) by Robert Beezer, which is also a free,
  open-source project.
