<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>This is a free/open-source textbook that provides an introduction to Linear Algebra.  There is a light emphasis on mathematical proof and a strong emphasis on applications, making this book appropriate for science and engineering majors and for mathematics majors who are taking Linear Algebra early in their college careers.  Math majors who have already had an introduction to proofs course -- my other open-source textbook “A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics” was written for such a course -- may benefit from a more advanced treatment that features proof.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#p-4">in-context</a></span>
