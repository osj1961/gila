<p id="p-62">The use of variables with multiple indices in the above definition bears comment.  First of all, note that we are trying to deal with the general situation where there is an unknown number of equations (\(m\)) in an unknown number of variables (\(n\)).  Let's consider the \(b\)'s first â€” these are the constants that appear on the right-hand sides of the equations, so there are \(m\) of them.  The situation for the \(a\)'s is more complicated.  The \(a\)'s are the coefficients, they are constant numbers that the variables are multiplied by, and there are two indices on each of them.  The first index tells us which equation we are in.  The second index matches with the subscript on the variable.  For example \(\aij{14}{23}\) would be the coefficient of \(x_{23}\) in the \(14\)th equation in a system.
