<p>We use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>scalar</em> to refer to real numbers, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>especially</em> when referring to the numbers that we multiply vectors by.  Calling them “constants” is probably not the best plan; both a scalar and a vector can be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>constant</em> — that just means they aren't changing.  It's usually more important to distinguish the vectors from the scalars — which things have multiple components and which don't?  When we think of vectors as “those things that have both a direction and a magnitude,” the effect of multiplying by a scalar is to leave the direction unchanged, but change the magnitude by scaling it as the scalar indicates.  If the scalar is less than 1, the magnitude of the vector will be reduced; if the scalar is greater than 1 it will be increased.  Of course, if the scalar is negative the direction <!--Style me with CSS--><em>will</em> be effected, but in a rather simplistic way: the vector ends up facing the opposite direction.
