<p>A transformation is a function whose inputs and outputs are vectors.  In order to discuss concepts like the range and domain of a transformation we'll need some terminology for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sets</em> of vectors.  When we are considering the set of all possible vectors of some type it is known as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>vector space</em>.  At first, we are going to be looking at the most basic and fundamental sorts of vector spaces — where the vectors are ordered tuples of real numbers — but be advised that later we will see that there are many other sorts of vectors!
