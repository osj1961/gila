<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Reordering</em> means what it sounds like.  The solution set is determined by checking whether a given solution vector satisfies <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all</em> of the equations.  It is pretty clear that the order that the equations are listed in is of little importance.  In many treatments of linear algebra an operation called “swapping” is used instead — swapping two equations is a special (particularly simple) instance of reordering and any more general reordering can be accomplished by a succession of swaps.
