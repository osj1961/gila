<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Recall that when we formed linear combinations of numbers we were allowed to “multiply by constants and add things up.”   So if we are planning to do the same thing with vectors we need to understand what it means to multiply a vector by a constant
