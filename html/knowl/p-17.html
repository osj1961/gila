<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>We glossed-over a small but important issue in the above.  How do we know that our answer was the only answer?  And for that matter, is it necessarily true that there must <!--Style me with CSS--><em>be</em> an answer to some system of equations?  These are what are known as existence and uniqueness questions:  Does there exist an answer to our problem?  (Existence.) And, if there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> an answer, how do we know it is the only answer? (Uniqueness.)  There are systems of equations where all of the possible behaviors are exhibited: no solutions, unique solutions and lots of solutions.
