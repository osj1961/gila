<p>Wait!  Should the last sentence really have started with the word “Finally”?  It seems like the system is still pretty complicated.  We certainly haven't achieved the simplest possible sort of linear system, but we <!--Style me with CSS--><em>have</em> turned the original system into a type that is known as “triangular”.  Do you see why?  This kind of system is very easy to solve by a process known as back-substitution.  The 3rd equation tells you the exact value of the third variable (\(x_3 = 9\)), you can then substitute that value into the second equation to obtain \(x_2 - 9 = -2\).  So now we can easily see that \(x_2=7\).  Hmmm.  Now we've got known values for \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) which we can substitute into the 1st equation to get
\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
   x_1  \amp {}+{} \amp   7 \amp {}+{} \amp   9  \amp {}={} \amp 21 \\
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}
