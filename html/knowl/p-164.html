<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In Physics (especially in the Tensor Analysis which is used in e.g. General Relativity) they distinguish between covariant and contravariant indices.  An entity with a single contravariant index is a vector, if instead there is a single covariant index it is known as a co-vector.  These concepts aren't identical to row/column vectors, but nevertheless, contravariant vectors are usually written as columns and covariant vectors as rows.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-5.html#p-164">in-context</a></span>
