<p>This system is different from the other systems we've seen so far.  It doesn't have a solution.  Its statement includes an impossibility; if \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) have a sum of \(2\) (from the first equation) how can they also have a sum of \(3\) (which is what the second equation asserts).  So there simply <!--Style me with CSS--><em>aren't</em> three numbers which can be used as the coefficients!
