<p>If you are currently at the point \((3,4)\) and you want to move to the point \((5,12)\) you
need to increase your \(x\)-coordinate by 2 units and you must increase your \(y\)-coordinate by 8 units.  We just described the vector \(\langle 2, 8 \rangle\), the numbers \(2\) and \(8\) are known as the components of the vector.  Note that this is different in a not-so-subtle way from the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>point</em> \((2,8)\).  The point is stationary, the vector is there to describe a change.  If you start at the origin and follow the directions specified by the vector \(\langle 2, 8 \rangle\) you will of course wind up at the point \((2,8)\), but if you start at some other point, it's equally obvious that you won't!.  Sometimes people will talk about “position vectors” in this sort of context — the position vector  \(\langle x,y \rangle\) goes from the origin to the point  \((x,y)\).  Generally, it is preferable to keep the distinction between points and vectors clear.  When you treat a vector as a position vector (i.e. think of it as a point) you are loosing something.  Ordinarily a vector is free; it can be slid around from one point to another so long as its components aren't changed.
