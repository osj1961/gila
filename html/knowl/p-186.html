<p>Notice that if the vectors had different lengths (I mean “lengths” as in “number of entries”) the process we've described wouldn't work out so good…  One of your fingers would be out of entries before the other!  This is our first example of an idea known as <em class="terminology">conformability</em>. Suppose we have a row vector of length \(m\) (that is, a \(1 \times m\) matrix) and a column vector of length \(n\) (in other words a \(n \times 1\) matrix), then they are <em class="terminology">conformable</em> if \(m=n\) and if \(m\neq n\) they are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> conformable, in which case the matrix product can't be computed.
