<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In the previous example the final matrix we wrote is actually known as the <em class="terminology">augmented matrix</em> of the system.  Sometimes it is a good idea to separate out the part of the matrix that appears to the left of the thin vertical line.  That part is known as the <em class="terminology">coefficient matrix</em> of the system.  This isn't just pedantry!  In many real-world applications we need to solve bunches of linear systems that all have the same coefficient matrix â€” so they only differ in the final column (a.k.a. the <em class="terminology">augmented column</em>) of their augmented  matrices.  We can take advantage of such a situation, essentially solving all of the systems while only doing the work of solving the first one!
