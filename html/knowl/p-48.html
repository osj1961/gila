<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Suppose you have $\(10,000\) that you want to invest in the stock market. After some research you've found three companies that you think will be good investments.  SolarCity Corp (SCTY) is trading at about $\(20\) per share.  SunPower - Solar energy company (SPWR) is trading at about $\(9\) per share. First Trust Global Wind Energy (FAN) is at about $\(12\) per share.  One equation you can immediately write down is

\begin{gather*}
20 x_1 + 9 x_2 + 12 x_3 = 10000,
\end{gather*}

where \(x_1\) is the number of shares of SCTY we will buy, \(x_2\) is the number of shares of SPWR, and \(x_3\) is the number of shares of FAN.
